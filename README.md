# Support Vector Regression Stocks Predictions

Sanitized and fit ten years worth of market data to three different models- 
* Linear Regression Model
* Quadratic (Polynomial) Regression Model 
* Radial Basis Function Regression Model

# Conclusion: 
With the presumption of a stable market, and accounting for a slight margin of error-

Linear and Quadratic Model, after two months of predictive testing on Amazon ($AMZN), I determined that
* On average, these models achieved around 70% predictive accuracy compared to Amazon's closing price from April and May 2021. 

Radial Basis Function, a linear combination of gaussian normal curves, after a month of testing on Amazon ($AMZN) and three different financial sectors (Consumer Discretionary, Information Technology, and Financials), I determined that
* On average, these models achieved around 80% predictive accuracy compared to Amazon's and braoder sectors' closing prices for the month of Math 2021.
